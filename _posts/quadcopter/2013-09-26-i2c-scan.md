I purchased three I2C sensor boards. I was not aware of the 5V vs. 3.3V situation, but I tried to run them on 3.3V and luckily they all seem to work fine.

- MPU-6050 (GY-521) gyroscope/accelerometer
- HMC5883L (GY-273) magnetometer
- BMP085 (GY-65) barometer

I had to solder the pin headers to the accelerometer/gyroscope and magnetometer. I don’t exactly have a steady hand so I wanted to smoke test all three sensor boards.

I ran the [I2C scanner](http://playground.arduino.cc/Main/I2cScanner) and found them all. It does not mean the sensors survived the heat but it’s better than nothing. The addresses are:

- MPU-6050: 0x68 (I connected AD0 to the ground)
- HMC5883L: 0x1E
- BMP085: 0x77
