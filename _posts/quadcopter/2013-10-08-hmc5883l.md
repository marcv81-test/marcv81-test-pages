The HMC5883L magnetometer works very much the same way as the MPU-6050 accelerometer/gyroscope: a few configuration registers to write, and a few others to read data from. I browsed the [data sheet](https://www51.honeywell.com/aero/common/documents/myaerospacecatalog-documents/Defense_Brochures-documents/HMC5883L_3-Axis_Digital_Compass_IC.pdf) and set all the registers to their default values except the mode, which I set to continuous instead of single-measurement. Again we had to be careful with the endianness.

I wrote a [library](https://github.com/marcv81/quadcopter/tree/81f19618fe6773caf1f94aa551347be4ef1a84ba/libraries/HMC5883L) and another [test sketch](https://github.com/marcv81/quadcopter/blob/81f19618fe6773caf1f94aa551347be4ef1a84ba/sketches/HMC5883LTest/HMC5883LTest.ino). Below are the first readings.

The amplitude of the values roughly matches the Earth's magnetic field (0.58-0.31 Ga). The aliasing visible in the graph is due to the low sampling frequency (15Hz).

We're good to use the magnetometer values for further processing.
