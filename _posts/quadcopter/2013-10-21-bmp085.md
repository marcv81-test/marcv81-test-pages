So far we've been lucky with our I2C devices. Both the MPU-6050 and the HML8553L follow a very simple workflow: read data, done. The BMP085 barometer is slightly more complicated. The workflow described in the [datasheet](https://dlnmh9ip6v2uc.cloudfront.net/datasheets/Sensors/Pressure/BST-BMP085-DS000-06.pdf) is the following.

1. Send temperature request
2. Wait (4.5ms)
3. Read raw temperature
4. Sent pressure request
5. Wait (between 4.5ms and 25.5ms depending on request type)
6. Read raw pressure
7. Compute real pressure from raw temperature and pressure

In total that's 9ms to 30ms spent waiting, which in microprocessor time is an eternity. The Arduino does not support parallel processing, if we decided to wait then everything else would be blocked (interrupts excepted). If we build a balancing robot or a multirotor that's a problem: we want to update the motors speed as fast as possible. The faster the updates the more stable the vehicle.

The generic solution is to divide all our processes in small slices that don't take too long to run. We then run each slice one after each other in our main loop. It's okay if we don't get a new value from each sensor at every cycle. Some sensors refresh faster than others: we just want to let the slow ones and the fast ones run at their own speed.

For the BMP085 this solution can be implemented using a finite-state machine.

The four states are in green, and the waits in orange. If we consider the possible I2C errors, the flowchart becomes slightly more complex.

We didn't mention the way to check if there is a pressure or temperature value available for us to read. The datasheet recommends to monitor the EOC pin but we could do without using an extra Arduino digital input. The author of [this blog](https://hwswbits.blogspot.co.uk/2012/09/eoc-bit-in-bosch-bmp085-i2c-registers.html) monitored the I2C registers and figured that the bit 5 of the 0xF4 register is the inverse of the EOC pin value. We'll use it in out isBusy() function.

The final step is to calculate the real pressure value from the raw temperature and pressure. The datasheet explains how to do this. Unfortunately reading it tells us more about the lack of motivation of its authors than about the formula to use. If you managed to implement it you would get the wrong pressure value. If on a stroke of genius you fixed the algorithm and calculated the right pressure, then the intermediate values given in the datasheet would not match. I spent far too much time on this than I should have and figured it was all down to an embarrassing number of errors on data types and integer arithmetic. Seriously?

Fortunately the datasheet also mentions we can contact Bosch to request an implementation of the algorithm in ANSI C. I received a very prompt answer and the code worked immediately.

Thanks to all the above we put together a [library](https://github.com/marcv81/quadcopter/tree/7948709a31a344f0dd60acde3b28fab6c964334d/libraries/BMP085) and a [test sketch](https://github.com/marcv81/quadcopter/blob/7948709a31a344f0dd60acde3b28fab6c964334d/sketches/BMP085Test/BMP085Test.ino) to read the pressure from the BMP085. The values are quite noisy, below is a graph attempting to estimate my local altitude using the [barometric formula](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barometric_formula) and the local pressure conditions at the time. I tried to apply a low pass filter, but there were still some low-frequency variations, probably micro-perturbations in the room.

Because of the noise I was interested in the oversampling parameter. A higher oversampling is slower but is supposed to give more stable data. To evaluate the impact of the parameter I compared the instant pressure values with the average of the past ten values for different oversampling values.

**Oversampling = 0**

The histogram is centered on 0 and the standard deviation is $\sigma = 4.49$ Pa, so 95% of the results shall be between $\pm 2 \sigma = 8.97$ Pa.

**Oversampling = 3**

The histogram is centered on 0 and the standard deviation is $\sigma = 3.07$ Pa, so 95% of the results shall be between $\pm 2 \sigma = \pm 6.15$ Pa.

The higher oversampling seems to stabilise slightly the noisy measures from the BMP085. At this point I'm not too sure it's worth the longer wait: this one will have to be adjusted after experimenting with different types of low pass filters when we implement the altitude estimation.
