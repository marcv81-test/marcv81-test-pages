I rebuilt the frame with two 150x2mm perspex sheets rather than a single 100x5mm one. I used M3 bolts rather than M5. It measures 470mm motor to motor, I dremeled the arms to size.

This version provides more space for the electronics and allows to velcro the battery underneath. I couldn't properly attach a battery to the previous one.

There is a tiny crack on the bottom sheet from overtightening one of the bolts. I expect it to get worse with the vibrations. We'll see.
