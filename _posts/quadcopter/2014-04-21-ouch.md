It was a bad idea to connect the FTDI programmer before unplugging the LiPo. I had not even connected the USB to a computer. The motors started suddenly, and stopped shortly after a propeller cut the USB cable, which for all I know is probably unrelated anyway.

The quadcopter only suffered minor damage, with a few bent pins.

And I didn't cut myself too bad either.

Lesson not really learnt as I can't see myself removing the propellers every time I program the Arduino. I just have to be careful and disconnect the LiPo after every use, which I knew anyway but wasn't careful enough about.
