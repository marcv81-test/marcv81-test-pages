**Moment of inertia with respect to the yaw axis**

Same as [just before](https://robokitchen.tumblr.com/post/99593827730/moment-of-inertia-with-respect-to-the-roll-pitch), but with respect to the yaw axis this time.

Oscillation period of the bifilar pendulum:

- 20T = 23.486 - 2.848, T = 1.0319s
- 20T = 44.056 - 23.486, T = 1.0285s
- 20T = 64.630 - 44.056, T = 1.0287s
- Average T = 1.0297s

Other experimental quantities:

- m = 0.958kg
- b = 0.235m
- L = 0.70m

Moment of inertia:

$$I = \frac{m g T^2 b^2}{4 \pi^2 L}$$

$$I = 0.0199 \:kg\:m^2$$
