I would like to use a PS2 controller with the quadcopter and maybe future projects. The analog sticks may not be as precise as a dedicated RC transmitter, but a dual shock is less thank half the size and much more durable for traveling.

I purchased a controller extension lead. I cut the cable in half: I'm only interested in the controller side. I then crushed the console side with a vise grip to identify the wires colors. The colors might differ from cable to cable, don't trust my findings.
